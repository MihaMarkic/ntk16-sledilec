# ntk16-sledilec
Demo material from my (Slovene language) presentation at NTK 2016. It features a simple three tier application.
The demo shows how docker helps in building and deploying the server tiers.

The material is divided into two parts: Sledilec and Docker.

Sledilec contains all the sources while 
Docker contains metadata and commands required to build and rund docker containers (server side).
Docker is further divided into destkop and pi, each using proper architecture (pi is on arm).

You can also pull docker images from [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/mihamarkic/).
Images with postfix -pi are arm based, while others are Intel based.
